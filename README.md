# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Project Content
[README.md](README.md): This file. It explains content and the use of [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)
[CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md): Describes the variables, the data, and any transformation performed on the data.
[run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R): Script to download data, run analysis, and produce *TidyData.txt* file with average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Running the analysis
[run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script can run from Rstudio by sourcing it or directly using R on a command line. 
The script will download https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip data and unzip it in the project directory.
It will then perform the analysis and create *TidyData.txt*
